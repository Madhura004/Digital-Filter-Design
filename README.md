## SIMULATION RESULTS :
   **Running the simulation, you should observe the following** :

  1.Filter Response: The output y_out will be the weighted sum of the input samples, as defined by the filter coefficients.

  2.Behavior: The output will reflect the effect of the FIR filter on the input signal, with a delay corresponding to the number of taps.

## PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS :
   1.Response Time: Measure how quickly the filter responds to changes in the input.

   2.Accuracy: Verify the output values against expected results based on the filter coefficients.

   3.Resource Utilization: Analyze the hardware resources used by the FIR filter, such as the number of registers and multipliers.

   4.Latency: Determine the latency introduced by the filter, which is the number of clock cycles between the input sample and the corresponding output.

   **By conducting a thorough performance analysis, you can ensure that the FIR filter meets the desired specifications and performs efficiently**.
